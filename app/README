## D308 â€“ The Traveling Companion
Welcome to the Traveling Companion, an Android application that functions as a travel itinerary planner and tracker. Use this app to create vacations, give them a name, note down your accommodations, set the dates you intend to travel, and plan excursions to take during your trip. Through the app you can share details of your vacation, notes attached to your excursions, and set alerts to let you know when the fun begins (and when it's time to head home) so you never miss a thing. Keep your travel plans organized and close at hand.

## BASIC INSTRUCTIONS
To operate, tap the "Begin" button to open the app and view all data stored on your local database. The main screen will show you all created vacations in order of creation. Tapping an existing vacation or the "Create vacation" button will take you to a screen for entering each vacation's details. On this screen, you will also see a list of any and all excursions you have created for that vacation. Tapping an existing excursion or the "Create excursion" button will take you to a screen for entering details for an excursion planned during that vacation. In both the vacation details and excursion details screens, you will notice a menu in the top right corner; tap to open a list of actions including saving your details and changes, deleting vacations and excursions, setting alerts for your dates, and sharing details. Remember to save your changes before you leave the current screen or they'll disappear!
